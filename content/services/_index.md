InSiliChem is now a well established group with expertise on a variety of computational chemistry methods with interest in fields at the interface between chemistry, biology and medicine. Since 2019, InSiliChem offers its skills in form of services that could help those groups and companies interested in molecular insights on their systems.

<br>
Those services include the execution of modeling experiment as well as consulting in aspects like:
<br>
- Homology modeling <br>
- protein-ligand dockings and virtual screening <br>
- modeling of catalytic and biocatalytic processes with QM approaches <br>
- Molecular Dynamics (classical and ab initio). <br>

Moreover, the expertise of the group in Python programming and the development of computational tools like [GaudiMM](https://github.com/insilichem/gaudi) can also serve possible clients interested in computational tools dedicated specifically at their problems.
