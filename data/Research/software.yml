  InSiliChem studies embark a variety of different modeling questions.
  From sequence analysis, protein-ligand dockings to QM/MM InSiliChem
  owns expertise that allows to work on very different systems. However,
  InSiliChem main focuses on systems with little structural information
  has urge to the development of computational softwares in the
  last 10 years. <br><br>


  Because of our research interest, we also do methodological development including new software.

  - title: Ground Computational Tools
    description: >
      We have a long standing expertise on well established methods in computational chemistry and structural bioinformatics.
      This includes: <br>
        - Homology modeling. <br>
        - Molecular Dynamics. <br>
        - Protein-ligand dockings and virtual screening. <br>
        - Quantum Mechanics and hybrid Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics.<br>
        - Scripting for analysis and modeling.<br>
      We adapt our work to the system and can work on standalone or multi-level approaches. This needs in house developments.
      All our tools can be reached at the InSiliChem GitHub platform.

  - title: Multi-level integrative computational strategies
    description: >
      In many of our works, the combination of several techniques is needed and has to be adapted to the problem under investigation. For that reason, we have been working
      on a multi-level platform named tangram that allow to work under a unique visual interface (UCSF Chimera) with most of the programs that we use (openMM,
      Gold, GaudiMM, etc.)

  - title: GaudiMM and derivatives
    description: >
      A common problem in molecular modeling is the lack of relevant structural starting point. We have been developing during the last 5 years
      a modeling platform especially dedicated to bring physically sound models using hypothesis driven methodology. Based on a multi-objective genetic algorithm,
      GaudiMM explores the conformational and chemical space by satisfying molecular descriptors (the objectives) under an evolutive process. GaudiMM is highly modular
      and particularly helpful for systems where standard methodologies are difficult to apply. It provides first order models that could be refined
      latter with modeling tools of higher quality.<br>
      GaudiMM offers a large ensemble of possibilities and extension. One example is gpathfinder that allows to detect small molecule pathways into proteins.

  - title: Predicting metal binding sites
    description: >
      A large part of the activity of the group is dedicated to metal bound systems. In this it is fundamental to have access to predictive tools for the simulation of
      metal binding process and the determination of metal binding sites in proteins. We have developed several updates in the molecular modeling framework specialized
      to metal binding processes. Regarding dockings, we have developed extensions into standard docking programs liek Gold to deal with metalloligands and also gave
      such abilities to GaudiMM. We also developed metal binding predictors that allow to identify those regions of the protein that could recognize metal ions or
      inorganic systems.
